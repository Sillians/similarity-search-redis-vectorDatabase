# Vector Similarity Search

## Overview
Vector similarity search is a technique that finds similar content or data according to their vector representations. 
Imagine each piece of data as a collection of numbers arranged in a specific way. By comparing these collections of numbers,
we can quickly search for similar content or data in larger datasets. It’s like finding similar books in a library by comparing 
their unique codes or similar pictures by comparing their pixel values. 


### Vector Representation
In vector similarity search, we represent data like documents, images, or products as vectors in a space with 
many dimensions. Each dimension represents a specific characteristic or attribute of the data. For example, 
in a document search system, each dimension could represent a word or term. With this method of organization, 
we can compare vectors and find similar data. This approach makes searching more effective because we capture 
important data features in a structured and measurable format.


### Indexing
To make similarity searches faster and more efficient, we create an index structure that organizes the vectors. 
Think of the index as a special way of organizing the data that allows us to quickly find similar vectors without 
comparing each pair in the dataset. Indexing is particularly helpful when dealing with large amounts of data because 
it significantly speeds up the search process. With the index, we can find relevant vectors much faster, 
saving time and resources.


### Distance Metric
We use a distance metric to determine how similar or dissimilar vectors are. 
This metric calculates the distance or dissimilarity between two vectors in the high-dimensional space. 
Different distance metrics are available, such as `Euclidean distance`, `cosine similarity`, and `dot product similarity`. 
The choice of which distance metric to use depends on the nature of the data and the specific needs of the application. 
Each distance metric has its strengths and is suitable for different data types. 


### Building the Index
The vectors and the chosen distance metric are used to build the index structure. 
Different types of index structures can be employed, including `k-d trees`, `ball trees`, `VP trees`, or random `projection trees`. 
These structures divide the high-dimensional space into smaller regions, allowing for efficient search by narrowing 
down the search space. Organizing the vectors this way allows us to quickly locate similar vectors without 
comparing all possible pairs. The index structure acts as a roadmap, guiding the search process and significantly 
speeding it up, especially when dealing with large datasets.


### Querying
To find similar vectors, we start with a query vector representing the object we’re interested in. 
The query vector is then compared to the indexed vectors using the chosen distance metric. 
The index structure plays a crucial role in this process by guiding the search. 
It directs the search to relevant regions of the high-dimensional space, which helps narrow down the number of vector 
comparisons required. By leveraging the index structure, we can efficiently locate similar vectors without comparing 
the query vector with every vector in the dataset. This approach saves time and computational resources, 
making the search process faster and more effective.


### Ranking and Retrieval
After comparing the query vector to the indexed vectors using the chosen distance metric, 
the retrieved vectors are usually ranked based on their similarity to the query vector. 
This ranking is determined by the distance values obtained from the distance metric. 
Vectors with smaller distances to the query vector are considered more similar and given higher ranks. 
Finally, the search results consist of the most similar vectors, based on the chosen distance metric, 
which are returned as the final output. This ranking process ensures that the most relevant and similar 
vectors are presented as the top search results.


### Post-processing
Additional post-processing steps may be applied to the search results in certain applications based on the 
application’s requirements. For instance, in a recommendation system, further steps such as filtering and 
ranking algorithms can be employed to personalize the recommendations according to user preferences. 
These post-processing steps help refine and tailor search results to match the users’ needs and preferences better. 
By incorporating these additional algorithms, the system can provide more targeted and personalized recommendations, 
enhancing the overall user experience.


By effectively representing objects as vectors, constructing an index structure, selecting a suitable distance metric,
and utilizing the index for efficient search, vector similarity search enables the retrieval of similar vectors 
from a high-dimensional space. The retrieved vectors are then ranked, and post-processing steps can be applied 
based on the application’s specific requirements.


## Distance Metrics in Vector Similarity Search

Distance metrics are an essential component of vector similarity search, as they provide a way to measure the similarity or 
dissimilarity between two vectors. Several types of distance metrics can be used in vector similarity search, 
each with strengths and weaknesses. The choice of distance metric will ultimately depend on the specific application 
and the type of data being analyzed.


### `Euclidean Distance:`
Euclidean distance measures the straight-line distance between two vectors in a multidimensional space. 
It’s calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between the corresponding elements of the two vectors.

- `Euclidean Distance Formula`

The Euclidean Distance between two vectors **A** and **B** is given by:

$$
\text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (A_i - B_i)^2} = \sqrt{(A_1 - B_1)^2 + (A_2 - B_2)^2 + \dots + (A_n - B_n)^2}
$$

Where:
- $A_i$ and $B_i$ are the individual components of vectors **A** and **B**, respectively.

L2-squared distance measures the distance between two vectors based on the Euclidean distance. 
It’s calculated as the sum of the squares of the differences between the corresponding elements of the two vectors.

- `L2-Squared Similarity Formula`

The L2-Squared Similarity between two vectors **A** and **B** is given by:

$$
\text{L2-Squared Similarity} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (A_i - B_i)^2 = (A_1 - B_1)^2 + (A_2 - B_2)^2 + \dots + (A_n - B_n)^2
$$

Where:
- $A_i$ and $B_i$ are the individual components of vectors **A** and **B**, respectively.
- $n$ is the dimensionality (number of components) of the vectors.



### `Dot Product Similarity:`
Dot product similarity measures the similarity between two vectors based on the dot product of the vectors. 
It’s calculated as the dot product of the two vectors.

- `Dot Product Similarity Formula`

The Dot Product Similarity between two vectors **A** and **B** is given by:

$$
A \cdot B = \sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i B_i = A_1 B_1 + A_2 B_2 + \dots + A_n B_n
$$

Where:
- $A \cdot B$ is the dot product of vectors **A** and **B**.

It’s calculated as the dot product of the two vectors divided by the product of their magnitudes.

- `Cosine Similarity Formula`

The Cosine Similarity between two vectors **A** and **B** is given by:

$$
\text{Cosine Similarity} = \cos(\theta) = \frac{A \cdot B}{\|A\| \|B\|}
$$

It’s calculated as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union.

- `Jaccard Similarity Formula`

The Jaccard Similarity between two sets **A** and **B** is given by:

$$
J(A, B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}
$$

Where:
- $|A \cap B|$ is the size of the intersection of sets **A** and **B**.
- $|A \cup B|$ is the size of the union of sets **A** and **B**.


### `Manhattan Distance:`
Manhattan distance measures the distance between two vectors based on the sum of the absolute 
differences between their corresponding elements.

- `Manhattan Distance Formula`

the corresponding elements of the vectors are different.

- `Hamming Distance Formula`

The Hamming Distance between two vectors **A** and **B** of equal length is given by:

$$
\text{Hamming Distance} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{1}(A_i \neq B_i)
$$

Where:
- $\mathbb{1}(A_i \neq B_i)$ is an indicator function that equals 1 if $A_i \neq B_i$, and 0 if $A_i = B_i$.
- $A_i$ and $B_i$ are the individual components of vectors **A** and **B**.
- $n$ is the length of the vectors.

The Hamming Distance counts the number of positions at which the corresponding components (or symbols) of **A** and **B** are different.


## Use Cases for Vector Similarity Search
1. `Image Search`: Vector similarity search can efficiently find similar images in a large database. This can also be used for object detection and facial recognition.

2. `Recommendation Systems`: Vector similarity search can be used to build recommendation systems that suggest products or services similar to the ones a user has liked or purchased previously. 
For example, a user’s purchase history can be represented as a vector, and the search algorithm can find all the products in the database similar to the user’s purchase history based on their features, 
such as category, price, and brand. This ability can be useful in applications such as `e-commerce`, `music`, `video streaming`, and `online advertising`.

3. `Fraud Detection`: Vector similarity search can detect fraudulent transactions by comparing the similarity between a query transaction and a database of known fraudulent transactions. 
For example, a query transaction can be represented as a vector, and the search algorithm can find all the transactions in the database that are similar to the query transaction based on their features, 
such as amount, location, and time of day. This ability can be useful in applications such as credit card fraud detection, insurance fraud detection, and money laundering detection.
