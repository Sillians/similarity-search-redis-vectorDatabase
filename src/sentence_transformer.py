"""
Sentence Transformers (a.k.a. SBERT) is the go-to Python module for accessing, using, and training state-of-the-art text and image embedding models.
It can be used to compute embeddings using Sentence Transformer models or to calculate similarity scores using Cross-Encoder models.
This unlocks a wide range of applications, including semantic search, semantic textual similarity, and paraphrase mining.

"""
With `SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")` we pick which Sentence Transformer model we load. 
In the example above, we load `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, which is a `MiniLM` model finetuned on a large dataset of over 1 billion training pairs. 
Using `SentenceTransformer.similarity()`, we compute the similarity between all pairs of sentences. 

As expected, the similarity between the last two sentences (0.5180) is higher than the similarity between the first two sentences (0.1530) 
or the second and the third sentence (0.0637).
